            In this city there are great many women who wear bits
            of metal on their ears. They have holes put in their 
            earlobes especially for this purpose. Almost as soon as I got
            here, I wanted to ask what these bits of metal on people's
            ears meant. But I didn't know if I could speak of this openly.
            My guidebook, for instance, says that in Europe you
            should never ask people you don't know very well 
            anything related to their bodies or religion. Sometimes I
            thought these bits of metal-especially when I saw one in
            the form of a scythe, bow or anchor-might be some sort of
            talisman.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            At first glance, the city doesn't strike me as particularly
            dangerous. Why, then, do so many women wear talismans
            on the street? Certainly it can get a bit spooky at times
            
         </p>
         <p>
            walking around the city alone.It's just that too few people
            live here. Even during the day I've often walked home from
            the train station without seeing anyone at all.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            If these bits of metal are supposed to be a talisman, why
            are they so popular among women? I didn't know the name
            of the evil force these women were trying to protect themselves
            from with this talisman's help. They never revealed its
            name to me, and I still haven't made a concerted effort to
            find out what it is. Where I come from, people say you
            should never utter the name of a dangerous being aloud. If
            you do, this being will really appear. It has to be named
            indirectly. For example, you can simply replace its name
            with "it".

            Gilda, a student who also lived in my building, always
            wore a triangular piece of metal on her er. The first time
            we had a real conversation, she told me that a fifty-five-year
            old librarian at the university had just committed suicide
            the day before. Up until her death, this librarian had fought
            to keep computers from being installed in her department.
            The woman couldn't have been intelligent, Gilda said, or
            she would have understood that computer are merely tools
            not monsters. But apparently the computers weren't the
            cause of her suicide. She had been suffering from severe
            depression for years. She'd lived alone, Gilda said, fingering
            her little triangle of metal.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            "What is the meaning of this piece of metal?" I asked.
            She looked at me in surprise and asked whether I meant her
            
         </p>
         <p>
            "earring". The word "ring" had an unsettling effect on me.
            Gilda replied indifferently that her earring was simply a
            piece of jewelry and had no meaning at all
            
         </p>
         <p>
            As I had supposed, Gilda was reluctant to discuss the
            earring's significance. Instead she told me that highly 
            educated women had put holes in their ears at a relatively late
            age, whereas working-class women started wearing earrings
            as girls.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            I had read in a book that there are cultures in which part
            of the sexual organ is cut away during the initiation rite. A
            different part of the body can be substituted, however ; the 
            feet, for example, or the ears. In this case not the earring
            itself but merely the perforation of the earlobe would be
            significant.
            
            
         </p>
         <p>
            But why was Gilda always nervous? One day she
            placed two porcelain dogs on her windowsill. She refused
            to put the pots of flowers I'd given her there. These dogs
            were to sit on the windowsill all day long and stand guard
            over her apartment, like the stone dogs where I come from
            that guard the Shinto shrines. Gilda said she often had the
            feeling, when she was alone in the apartment, that a strange
            man was coming into her room through the window.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            Once she knocked on my door in the middle of the
            night and said there was something wrong with her 
            computer. I was really quite surprised she'd woken me up for
            this, since she knew I didn't know the first thing about
            computers. But soon I understood what the matter was :
            
            
         </p>
         <p>
            Gilda claimed there was an alien living inside her
            computer and producing sentences. She kept discovering
            sentences in her essays that she definitely hadn't written her
            self. But she refused to give me any examples; she said the
            sentences were indecent.I advised her to attach a talisman
            to her computer to make the evil force leave and keep new
            ones from coming. I used the term "evil force" because I
            didn't know what else to call it.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            The talisman Gilda selected wasn't at all what I'd had in
            mind: I'd imagned something like a doll made of reeds or
            a piece of snakeskin. But Gilda went to a health food store
            and purchased three stickers. Each sticker bore an image
            that was no doubt intended to epitomize the evil force: a
            car, a nuclear power plant, a gun. And above each image
            stood the words: No thanks.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            It struck me overly polite to express gratitude while
            rejecting an evil force, but perhaps the word "thanks" was
            simply intended to avoid provoking the opponent's 
            aggression.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            Gildapasted the stickers on the front of her computer,
            next to the screen, and appeared satisfied with them. A
            week later she bought three more stickers and put them on
            her bicycle, the refrigerator and the door of her apartment.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            But I don't think she was completely reassured. Her
            computer, it's true, was now clean, but as if to make up for
            this, she began to feel as though an alien being were forcing
            
         </p>
         <p>
            its way into her body. She bought herself a sweater with a
            big tiger's head on it. Everyone who approached her had to
            brave the tiger's fierce gaze. Gilda also bought herself a
            jacket made from the skin of a dead animal. She wore tight
            pants printed in a leopard-skin pattern and a belt studded
            several triangular bits of metal. It wouldn't have 
            surprised me if she'd put on a mask with a lion's face.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            Despite all this, her misgivings remained. At dinner, for
            instance, when she sat alone in the kitchen eating her soup,
            she suddenly has the impression tht the soup contained
            everything she'd been trying to avoid all this time. She told
            me she'd decided to fast for a week or two. There were so
            many poisons in food, she explained, and, besides, she had
            too much excess flesh on her body.Gilda wasn't fat, but she
            was incapable of loving her own flesh because she sensed
            within it the presence of an alien element. She called this
            element  "chemicals". Every culture has its own purification
            ceremony, or several of them. In this city, however, the
            ceremony has no predetermmined day, time or opening prayer.
            There are no specifications, or at least no rules I could 
            recognize as such. One day Gilda bought herself a book on
            fasting, and a few days later, when I met her on the stairs,
            she had lready started. Her face looked less narrow than
            usual: it was almost round, as though there were water
            trapped beneath the skin. The piece of metal on her ear
            appeared heavier and colder than before. I swallowed the
            
         </p>
         <p>
            words I'd meant to say to her, for she seemed to me, all at
            once, like a stranger who-although I lived in her 
            language-couldn't have understood me.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            On her door flapped a sticker that was trying to come
            unstuck from the smooth metal
